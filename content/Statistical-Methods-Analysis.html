			<h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
				
			<h3>Meaning</h3>
			<p>
				Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of population. <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				They can be useful in two purposes: <br>
				> Provide basic information about variables in a dataset. <br>
				> To highlight potential relationships between variables. <br>

				They can be broken down into two measures: <br>
				> Measures of central tendency. <br>
				> Measure of variability (spread).
			</p>

			<h3>Graphical representations</h3>
			<p>
				Graphical and pictorial methods of representation provide a visual representation of the data. </p>
			<p>
				Different types of pictorial representations used are: <br>
				Histograms <br>
				Scatterplots <br>
				Geographical Information Systems (GIS) <br>
				Sociograms <br>
			</p>

			<h4>Histograms</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In this visually the frequencies are represented with which values of variables occur. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Each value of a variable is displayed along the bottom of a histogram, and a bar is drawn for each value.
				</li>
				<li>
					The height of the bar is corresponding to the frequency with which that value occurs.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Scatterplots</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Display the relationship between two quantitative or numeric variables by plotting one variable against the value of another variable.
				</li>
				<li>
					For example, one axis of a scatter plot could represent height and the other could represent weight. Each person in the data would receive one data point on the scatter plot that corresponds to his or her heights and weights.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A GIS is a computer system capable of capturing, storing, analyzing and displaying geographically referenced information, that is data identified according to location.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using a GIS program, a researcher can create a map to represent data relationships visually.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Sociograms</h4>
			<p>
				Display networks of relationships among variables, enabling researchers to indentify the nature of relationships that could otherwise be too complex to conceptualize.
