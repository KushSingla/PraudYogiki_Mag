			<h2>What is a dielectric ?</h2>
			<p>Today, we are going to start with the basics of antenna substrate. The main focus will remain on the dissipation factors of the same. We will first start with the meaning of dielectric.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Dielectric</b>, insulating material or a very poor conductor of electric current. When dielectrics are placed in an electric field, practically no current flows in them because, unlike metals, they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material. Instead, electric polarization occurs. The positive charges within the dielectric are displaced minutely in the direction of the electric field, and the negative charges are displaced minutely in the direction oppposite to the electric field. This slight separation of charge, or polarization, reduces the electric field within the dielectric.</li>
				<li>The presence of dielectric material affects other electrical phenomena as was mentioned due to the polarization of the electric charges inside the material.</li>
				<li>The force between two electric charges in a dielectric medium is less than it would be in a vaccum, while the quantity of energy stored in an electric field per unit volume of a dielectric medium is greater.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What is dielectric constant(ϵr) ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>First of all, what is permittivity of a material ? - The ability of a material to store electrical potential energy under the influence of an electric field is known as its permittivity.</li>

				<li>Dielectric constant (ϵr) is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of the material to the permittivity of the free space. It expresses the extent to which a material can hold electric flux in it.</li>

				<li> It is mathematically expressed as: <br><br>
				
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					ϵr = ϵ/ϵo <br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					where, <br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					<ul>
						<li>ϵr is the dielectric constant</li>
						<li>ϵ is the permittivity of the material</li>
						<li>ϵo is the permittivity of the free space</li>
					</ul>
				</li>	

				<li>It is a dimensionless quantity.</li>
				<li>The relative permittivity of a dielectric material is also called a dielectric constant.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Why only dielectric materials used as substrate ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Dielectrics are used for imporved electrical and mechanical stability. They are used to reduce the size of the antenna (higher permittivity, lower size) and help to produce displacement current. As a wholesum a substrate can enhance antenna's radiation capability. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Can silver or gold be used for microstrip line and ground instead of copper ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Yes, they can be used since, silver has higher conductivity than copper or gold.</li>
				<li>But copper is much harder than the other two. Alas, copper is highly reactive.</li>
				<li>The most common significance of using copper is its cheap.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What is loss tangent ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Loss tangent</b> (tan (δ)) is the measure of signal loss due to the inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy in the substrate of the substrate.</li>
				<li>It is a dimensionless quantity and generally referred to: loss factor, tan δ, dissipation factor and loss angle.</li>
				<li>Loss tangent depends on the conductivity, frequency and permittivity.<br><br>
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<b>loss tangent = conductivity/(2*pi*frequency*permittivity)</b>

				</li>
			</ul>
