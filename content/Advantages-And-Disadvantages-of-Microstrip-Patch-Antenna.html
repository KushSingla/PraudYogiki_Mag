			<p>Here we are going to study about the advantages and disadvantages of microstrip patch antenna. I know they are pretty much common but since more we know more are better.</p>

			<p>Microstrip antennas have several advantages compared to conventional microwave antennas, and therefore many applications cover the broad frequency range from ~ 100 MHz to ~ 100 GHz. Some of the principal advantages of microstrip compared to conventional microwave antennas are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Light weight, low volume, and thin profile configurations, which can be made conformal.</li>
				<li>Low fabrication cost; readily amenable to mass production.</li>
				<li>Linear and circular polarizations are possible with simple feed.</li>
				<li>Dual-frequency and dual-polarization antenna can be easily made.</li>
				<li>No cavity backing is required.</li>
				<li>Can be easily integrated with microwave integrated circuits.</li>
				<li>Feed lines and matching networks can be fabricated simultaneously with the antenna structure.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>However, microstrip antennas also have some limitations compared to conventional microwave antennas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Narrow bandwidth and associated tolerance problems.</li>
				<li>Somewhat lower gain (~6 dB).</li>
				<li>Large ohmic loss in the feed structure of arrays.</li>
				<li>Most microstrip antennas radiate into half-space.</li>
				<li>Complex feed structures required for high-performance arrays.</li>
				<li>Polarization purity is difficult to achieve.</li>
				<li>Poor end-fire radiator except tapered slot antennas.</li>
				<li>Extraneous radiation from feeds and junctions.</li>
				<li>Lower power handling capability (~100W).</li>
				<li>Reduced gain and efficiency as well as unacceptably high levels of cross-polarization and mutual coupling within an array environment at high frequencies.</li>
				<li>Excitation of surface waves.</li>
				<li>Microstrip antennas fabricated on a substrate with a high dielectric constant are strongly preferred for easy integration with MMIC RF front-end circuitry. However, use of high dielectric constant substrate leads to poor efficiency and narrow bandwidth.
				</li>
			</ul>
