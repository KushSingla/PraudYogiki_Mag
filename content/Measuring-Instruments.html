			<p>Hello everyone, we are back again. I having thinking a time to complete the notes, I only got time today. So, anyways focusing on the concept we have. The most common terms before starting the concept of measuring instruments are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Instrument : </i> A tool used to collect data.</li>
				<li><i>Test : </i> A formal, systematic procedure for gathering information.</li>
				<li><i>Assessment : </i> The general process of collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting information.</li>
				<li><i>Measurement : </i>The process of quantifying or scoring a subject's performance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Instruments are tools of a researcher- each tool is used for a specific purpose.<br>
			Tools researchers use to collect data for research studies (alternatively called "tests")<br>
			Tools of the data collection which allow the researcher to implement the research method and to produce data for analysis.
			</p>

			<h2>Measuring instrument/tools</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A device used to quantify and record information that is important to a research study.</li>
				<li>In physical sciences, measuring instruments: scales, rulers, meters etc.</li>
				<li>In technical education research, these are: tests, questionnaries, observations, interview schedules etc.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Each of these used to measure (or quantify) and to record the measurement.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Scales of Measurement</h2>
			<h3>Nominal measurement scales</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Only the assign numbers for purposes of identification and classification; e.g., A<sub>1</sub> to teachers and A<sub>2</sub> to administrators.</li>
				<li>Questionaries, document review forms and interview schedules.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Ordinal measurement scales</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Quantitative qualities that can be used to classify further, i.e., by rank ordering things or people.</li>
				<li>Only tells rank order and not distance between ranks.</li>
				<li>Questionaries, opinionaries, observation forms and some teacher-made tests.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Interval Measurement scales</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identification and rank order characteristics.</li>
				<li>Equal intervals between the numbers on the scale.</li>
				<li>Tests and rating scales.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Ratio measurement scales</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>An interval scale that has an absolute.</li>
				<li>Only in physical measurement.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Some important terms that are helpful in the further classification.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Cognitive tests</i>: Examining subjects' thoughts and thought processes.</li>
				<li><i>Affective tests</i>: Examining subjects' feelinggs, interests, attitudes, beliefs, etc.</li>
				<li><i>Standardized tests</i>: Tests that are administered, scored and interpreted in a consistent manner.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Measurement instruments</h2>
			<h3>Cognitive instruments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Measure an individual's attainment in academic areas typically used to diagnose strengths and weaknesses.</li>
				<li>Cognitive instruments are of different types: Achievement tests and aptitude tests.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Achievement tests</i>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide information about how well the test takers have learned what they have been taught in institute.</li>
							<li>Achievement is determined by comparing it to the norm, the performance of group of similar students who have taken the same test.</li>		
						</ul> 
					</li>
					<li><i>Aptitude tests</i>
						<ul>
							<li>Measure the intellect ad abilities not normally taught and often are used to predict future performance.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Affective instruments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Measure characteristics of individuals along a number of dimensions and to assess fellings, values, and attitudes toward self, others, and variety of other activities, institutions, and situations.</li>
				<li>Types of affective instruments are: Attitude scales, values tests, personality inventories</li>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Attitude scales</i>
						<ul>
							<li>Self-reports of an individual's beliefs, perceptions, or feelings about self, others, and a variety of activities, institutions, and situations.</li>
							<li>Frequently use liker, semantic differential, thurstone, or guttman scales.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><i>Values tests</i> 
						<ul>
							<li>Measure the relative strength of an individual's valuese of theoretical, economic, asthetic, social, political, and religious values.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><i>Personality inventories</i>
						<ul>
							<li>An individual's self-report measuring how behaviors characteristics of defined personality traits describe that individual.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>Projective instruments</h3>
			<p>Measure a respondent's feelings or thoughts to an ambiguous stimulus.</p>

			<h3>Standardized instruments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>They are carefully developed, highly refined measurement procedures, and designed for administration under carefully prescribed conditions for some specific purpose.</li>
				<li>Include estimates of reliability and validity that are based on sound experiment research.</li>
				<li>Normative data.</li>
				<li>E.g., standardized achievement test, aptitude test, ability test, interest inventory, projective measures etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Researcher or teacher constructed instruments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>They are developed for specific research needs where standardized instruments are not available.</li>
				<li>Need for consistent administration procedures.</li>
				<li>Consistent scoring procedures.</li>
				<li>Constructed with reliability and validity in mind.</li>
				<li>May not be possible to administer the instrument to a large number of people and establish standardized norms.</li>
				<li>It includes questionnaries, interview schedule, observation form, opinionnarie/attitude scale, document analysis form, teacher-made achievement test.</li>
				<li>Ensure reliability, validity, consistent administration and scoring procedures.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Tests</h3>

				<li>Developed using sophisticated procedures & undergone extensive tryout & evaluation.</li>
				<li>Published commercially</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Aptitude test</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Measure an individual's potential or probability of success in a particular activity or occupation, e.g., clerical, mechanical, maths, etc.</li>
				<li>Emphasis is on future prediction.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Ability test</h4>

				<li>Determine an individual's level of mental functioning or intelligence.</li>
				<li>Paper & pencil or practical in form.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Interest inventory</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Assess an individual's interest in something, e.g. career or occupational interests, etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Projective Measures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Project internal feelings, attitudes, needs values or wishes to an external object.</li>
				<li>A drawing or a picture and to describe what he sees.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Questionnarie</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A written instrument containing a series of questions to which individuals respond.</li>	
				<li>Completed independently by an individual.</li>
				<li>Through mail or personally distributed.</li>
				<li>Gather factual information.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Strengths</h3>

				<li>Requries a little time of the respondent.</li>
				<li>Allow for a broad geographic sampling.</li>
				<li>Low cost of distribution & return.</li>
				<li>Low research time in administration.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

				<li>Ability to probe for details or explanations of responses not possible.</li>
				<li>Response rrate may be limited.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Designing a questionnarie</h3>

			</ul>
			<h3>Desinging an interview schedule</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Determine the content of an interview</li>
				<li>Developing items for interview schedule (dichotomous response, multiple choice items, rating items, open-ended items).</li>
				<li>Organizing and assembling interview schedule:
					<ul>
						<li>Prepare an interview introduction.</li>
						<li>Order of the interview schedule: first question, last question.</li>
						<li>Use of funnel sequences (asking the most general or unrestricted question in an area first, and following it with successiveely more restricted questions). </li>
						<li>Final preparation of interview schedule.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Checklist</h2>
			<p>Checklists are a list of questions or criteria, which represent the impact areas of an impact assessment or which divide them into their main fields of application. By providing a checklist it is ensured that all relevant impact areas are taken account of by the IA analyst.</p>

			<h2>Observation Schedules/forms</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Focus the researcher on the occurance of certain behaviours or objects.</li>
				<li>Checklist or rating form.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Types</h3>
			<h4>Systematic direct observation</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Observing people, objects or events and the recording of observations through the use of a highly structured instrument.</li>
				<li>Researcher must train himself in the process of observation and be familiar with the observation instrument being used.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Participant Observation</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Such observations by an individual who places himself within a situation, not primarily as a researcher.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Designing an observation form</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Determine the content (outcome/ purpose of the study, research questions or hypotheses and criterion qustions) </li>
				<li>Items of an observation form
					<ul>
						<li>Checklists (list of behaviours or activities that are checked by an O as being observed during a particular observation session).  </li>
						<li>Rating scales</li>
						<li>Frequency scales</li>
						<li>Field note forms (sometimes it is needed to record results). </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Orgainizing and assembling observation form
					<ul>
						<li>Order of items</li>
						<li>Final preparation (instructions as guidelines to the O). </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Evaluating Research instruments</h2>
			<h3>Selecting an appropriate type of instrument</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Match between the instrument and research method/questions.<br>
				Descriptive research; questionnaire, interview or document analysis form.</li>
				<li>What is the relationship between student interest and achievements ? <br>
				Correlational research; an interest inventory and achievement test.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Administering the instrument</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make arrangements in advance.</li>
				<li>Ensure ideal testing environment.</li>
				<li>Be prepared for all probable contingencies.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Two issues in using instruments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Validity</i>: The degree to which the instrument measures what it purports to measure. </li>
				<li><i>Reliability</i>: The degree to which the instrument consistency measures what it purposes to measure. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Types of validity</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Content validity</b> (the degree to which an instrument measures an intended content area).<br>
				Forms of content validity:<br>
				<i>Sampling validity</i>: does the instrument reflect the total content area ?<br>
				<i>Item validity</i>: Are the items included on the instrument relevant to the measurement of the intended content area ?
				</li>
				<li><b>Criterion-related validity</b> an individual takes two forms of an instrument which are then correlated to discriminate between those individuals who possess a certain characteristic from those who do not forms of Criterion-related validity.<br>
				<i>Concurrent validity</i>: the degree to which scores on one test correlate to scores on another test when both tests are administered in the same time frame.<br>
				<i>Predictive validity</i>: the degree to which a test can predict how well individual will do in a future situation.
				</li>
				<li><b>Construct validity</b> a series of studiese validate that the instrument really measures what it purports to measure. </li>
			</ol>			

			<h3>Types of Reliability</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Stability ("test-retest")></i>: the degree to which two scores on the same instrument are consistent over time. </li>
				<li><i>Equivalence ("equivalent forms")</i>: the degree to which identical instruments (except for the actual items included) yield identical scores.  </li>
				<li><i>Internal consistency ("split half" reliability with Spearman-Brown correction formula, Kuder-Richardson and Cronback's Alpha reliabilities, scorer/rater reliability) </i>: the degree to which one instrument yields consistent results. </li>
			</ul>
