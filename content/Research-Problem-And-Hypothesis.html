			<h2>Steps of research methodology</h2>
			<p>In general it means steps that are to be taken to do reserach. There are four steps:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Selecting and defining a research problem</dt>
					<dd>A review of related literature is done to specify the research problem, research questions and hypotheses.</dd>
				<dt>Describing the research methodology</dt>
					<dd>Selecting an approporiate research design.</dd>
				<dt>Collecting of data</dt>
					<dd>Using instruments, recording data, scoring and tabulating the former and later for analysis.</dd>
				<dt>Analyze and interpret the results</dt>
					<dd>Selecting and appying appropriate statistical tools to arrive to valid conclusions.</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2>General problem situation into a research problem ?</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Problem situation</li>
				<li>preliminary list of contributing factors and explanations</li>
				<li>elimination of irrelevant facts</li>
				<li>list of relevant facts and explanations</li>
				<li>basic assumptions</li>
				<li>research problem</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The variables</h2> 
			<ul>
				<li>Something that varies is known as variable.</li>
				<li>hehehe !! already knew that</li>
				<li>
					<dl>
						<dt>Research attempts</dt>
								<dd># Try to understand why difference in one variable affects the difference in another variable ?</dd>
								<dd># Do ask about the relationship betweeen one or more independent and dependent variable.</dd>
					</dl>
				</li>
				<li>independent variables are the ones that have presumed effect on dependent variables and are manipulated by scientists.</li>
				<li>on the other hand dependent variables are the ones that are have presumed affect of independent variables on them. Dependent variables are not manipulated, they are observed.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now before going further, we would like to talk about the indentification of a research problem</p>
			<ul>
				<li>this is the first and foremost step in any research to be carried out.</li>
				<li>difficult for inexperienced researchers, and novice/beginners in research to conceptualize a research problem</li>
				<li>Some dificulty or unclear situation which a researcher experiences in practical or theoretical context and intends to obtain a tangible explanation, clarification or offer solution to it.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Secondly, generally its not neccesary that one will find a research problem, everytime he/she will be struck with a problem.So, a researcher should be prepared to select a particular research problem from the existing content. </p>
			<p>For that the sources required are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>personal, practical/teaching experiences.</li>
				<li>classroom, laboratory, institution, community, textbook, consultation with faculty.</li>
				<li>critical study of literature.</li>
				<li>interaction/discussion with others.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So we get the sources, now the issue is what is the criteria to select a particular research problem to do research on ?</p>

			<p>Answer to this question is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Interest</li>
				<li>size</li>
				<li>economy</li>
				<li>feasibility</li>
				<li>researchable</li>
				<li>researcher's capabilities and limitations</li>
				<li>uniqueness</li>
				<li>national or agency priorities</li>
				<li>urgency of an issue</li>
				<li>availability of research funds</li>
				<li>availability of supervision</li>
				<li>ethical issues</li>
				<li>management support</li>
				<li>indentifying variables</li>
			</ul>

			<p>After getting the criteria of how to select a research problem now is the time to know what should be in mind while writing/defining reserach problems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>indentifying broad area</li>
				<li>stating the problem clearly</li>
				<li>Avoiding unnecessary words</li>
				<li>avoid value statements</li>
				<li>avoid dichotomous questions or avoid questions which have answers only in yes or no format</li>
				<li>Avoid problems related to::
					<ul>
						<li>moral, ethical issues</li>
						<li>philosphical issues</li>
						<li>theological issues</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>think of hunches or guesses of results</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Continuing further we proceed to writing research questions::</p>

			<p>Getting the problem is done. The researcher now needs to evaluate the problem defined:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>whether the problem is feasible or worthwhile ?</li>
				<li>is the problem feasible ?</li>
				<li>is the specified problem amenable (open and responsive to studies)</li>
				<li>is the problem too large to be managed?</li>
				<li>is the sufficient data available ?</li>
				<li>am I capable of solving the problem?</li>
				<li>is the problem worthwhile ?</li>
			</ul>


			<p>We have a formed checklist for testing the feasibility of the research problem:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>is the problem of current interest ?</li>
				<li>will the research results have social, educational or scientific value ?</li>
				<li>will it be possible to apply the results in practise ?</li>
				does the research contribute to the science of education ?</li>
				<li>will the researchf opt new problems and lead to further research ?</li>
				<li>is the research problem important ?</li>
				<li>will you be proud of the result ?</li>
				<li>is there enough scope left within the area of research ?</li>
				<li>can you find an answer to the problem through research ?</li>
				<li>will you be able to handle the research problem ?</li>
				<li>will it be practically possible to undertake the research ?</li>
				<li>will it be possible for another researcher to repeat the research ?</li>
				<li>is the research free of any ethical problems and limitations ?</li>
				<li>will it have any value ? do you have the necessary knowledge and skills to do the research ?</li>
				<li>are you qualified to undertake the research ?</li>
				<li>is the problem important to you and are you motivated to undertake the research ?</li>
				<li>is the research viable in your situation ? do you have enough time and energy to complete the project ?</li>
				<li>do you have the necessary funds for the research ?</li>
				<li>will you be able to complete the project within the time available ?</li>
				<li>do you have access to the administrative, statistic and computer facilities the research necessitates ?</li>
			</ul>


			<p>Good morning peeps, sorry its after noon, my bad.</p>

			<p>Anyways, today we are starting with "Hypothesis". As the name suggests, I think most of you know about what hypothesis means. To be formal, A hypothesis is a guess or attempt to explain the nature of relationship between variables indentified in the problem.</p>

			<p>Hypothesis are very common, apart from research problem hypothesis are made daily to any kind of problem. In simpler terms, a hypothesis is a simple effort made to solve a problem by assuming different situations or connections between the variables of the problem.</p>

			<p>Some points related to hypothesis:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hypotheses flow from the problem statement, literature review, and the theroretical framework.</li>

				<li>Hypotheses are formulated before the study is conducted because they provide direction for the collection, analysis and intrepretation of data.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So after understanding the definition of hypothesis lets move forward towards the functions which a hypothesis performs.</p>

			<p>The functions are::</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>It gives a statement of a relationship that is empirically testable and can be found to be either true or false.</li> 
				<li>It gives direction to a study.(i.e. design, sampling, data collection .. etc.)</li>
				<li>It suggests the type of statistical analysis to be used in the study.</li>
				<Li>It gives continuity to a study by providing a basis for drawing conclusions from the study.</Li>
			</ul>



			<p>Moving forward, we have the types of hypotheses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Null hypothesis: It is a statement of the status quo, one of no difference or no effect. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, no changes will be made.</li>

				<li>Alternative hypothesis: It is one in which some difference or effect is expected. Accepting the alternative hypothesis will lead to changes in opinions or actions.</li>

				<li>Directional hypothesis: It specifies the expected direction of the relationship between independent and dependent variables.</li>

				<li>Non-directional hypothesis: It indicates the existence of a relationship between the variables but does not specify the anticipated (predicted/expected) direction of the relationship.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>Now after listening all the definitions given above we conclude that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One researcher need to conver the research question to null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
				
				<li>The null hypothesis (H0) is a claim of "no difference in the population" (it states that there is no relationship betweeen independent and dependent variables)</li>

				<li>The alternative hypothesis (Ha) claims "H0 is false" (it states that it is a statement of expected relationship between the variables. It can be directional or non-directional)</li>

				<li>In a summary one can also say that collecting data and seeking evidence against H0 as a way of bolstering (supporting) Ha (deduction).</li>

			</ul>

			<p>When we have learned all about what hypothesis is and what are the functions of a hypothesis then we need to understand what we conclude from the hypothesis or we can say what conclusions we have formed.</p> 
			<p>So forming conclusions have some key points in case of hypothesis as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>every hypothesis test ends with the experimentations either:</li>
					<ul>		
						<li>rejecting the null hypothesis</li>
						<li>failing to reject the null hypothesis</li>
					</ul>
				<li>null hypothesis is something that is defined but it's never accepted. The reason is every time a researcher will definitely have some changes which need to be done in the initial hypothesis (which means rejection of null hypothesis). But, this state can come where one has to accept null hypothesis when researcher doesn't have enough evidence to support his change or any alteration in the initial hypothesis.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Before proceeding towards the ending there are some famous quotes which are related to hypothesis that are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A hypothesis can either be supported or not supported by study findings.</li>

				<li>Rejection of the statistical hypothesis is equivalant to acceptance of research hypothesis.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Finally after all the forming, breaking, again forming and concluding we have evaluation of the hypothesis which we are left with</p>
			<p> ha ha ha, doesn't it sound funny to you. </p>
			<p>Anyways, let's head towards the evaluation question of hypothesis::</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Does the hypothesis directly relate to the research problem ?</li>
				<li>Is the hypothesis plausible (means does it seem reasonable) (i.e. logical) ?</li>
				<li>Has the hypothesis been developed prior to collecting the data ?</li>
				<li>is the hypothesis testable ? (define variables & indicate their relationships/measurements)</li>
				<li>is the hypothesis based on known facts ? (rather than on pure observation)</li>
				<li>is the hypothesis simply written in declarative form ?</li>
			</ul>
