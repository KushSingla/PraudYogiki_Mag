			<p>So the topic which we need to study is the introduction to educational research ?</p>

			<p>this includes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Concept or definition of educational research</li>
				<li>Some different types of educational research includes:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Basic</li>
						<li>Applied</li>
						<li>Action</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

			<h2>What is the need for educational research</h2>

			<p>Fellas we are back</p> 
			<p>I hope you missed !!!! </p>
			<p>(^-^), ha ha ha !! </p>
			<p>You know I also hate this subject it's just so boring and argggggghh!!</p>

			<p>Anyways, so new topic new spirit, this seems right no, ha ha ha !!</p>
			<p>I am out mymind I know that.</p> 
			<p>Anyways finally we are now talking about educational research. As per the tradition what is meant by educational research. </p>
			<p>As the name suggestes research that is done in the field of education, right? I would say no!!</p> 
			<p>No, is for not the definition is wrong. No, is for that the definition is incomplete.</p> 
			<p>One of our great educationist said something about educational research that I myself find very intruging and good too. It is:: "Educational research is no joke.</p> 
			<p>ha ha ha ha !!! Obviously he didn't say that ha ha ha !!".</p> 
			<p>Okay on a serious note let's see what Mr. W. M. Traverse said about educational research.</p><p> He says: "Educational research is that activity which is directed towards the development of science of behaviour in educational situations."</p>

			<p>Peeps, definition seems a bit old or ancient but its meaning goes deep.</p> 
			<p>Some of you might also be wandering that what does science has to do with educational research ?, because science means PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) or PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) right !!!.</p> 
			<p>No, it does not only mean that.</p> 
			<p>Sciencecouncil.org says that "science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence."</p>


			<p>I think after listening to the definition it might be clear that educational research is not only the research which one do in the field of education it means more than that. As per Mr. Traverse and many other educationist it can be seen that educational research is more of a development path of one's behaviour about education.</p> 

			<p>Some of the features of educational research are::</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is directed towards the solution of a problem in the field of education. It may attempt to answer a question or to determine the relation between two or more variables. </li>

				<li>It emphasizes the development of generalizations, principles or theories that will be helpful in predicting future occurences.</li>

				<li>Educational research involves getting new data from primary or first hand sources or using existing data for a new purpose.</li>

				<li>Educational research accepts only what can be verified by observation. Certain interesting questions do not tend themselves to research procedures.</li>

				<li>Research strives (make great efforts to achieve or obtain something) to objective and logical, applying every possible test to validate the procedures employed, the data collected and the conclusions reached. The researcher attempts to eliminate personal bias.</li>

				<li>Research requires expertise. The researcher knows what is already known about the problem and how others have investigated.</li>

				<li>Educational research involves the quest to answers to unsolved problems. Pushing back the frontiers of ignorance is its goal and originality is frequently the quality of a good research project.</li>

				<li>Educational research is based on insight and imagination. It needs the service of man who looks beyong the present.</li>

				<li>Educational research requires interdisciplinary approach. It is related to the study of complex relations about facts.</li>

				<li>Educational research is not so exact a research as physical science.</li>

				<li>Educational research has a great field. Educational psychology, educational philosophy, methodology, class organization and management, child development and other subject are the fields of research in education.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So now after knowing about the many characteristics of educational research we have come across the types of the later. </p>

			<p>Some the known and easy types of educational research are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>basic or fundamental research::</li> 
					<ul>
						<li>Basic research is primarily conerned with the formulation of a theory or a contribution to the existing body of knowledge.</li> 
						
						<li>The main of basic research is the discovery of knowledge solely for the sake of knowledge.</li> 
						
					 	<li>Mainly the focus of this type of educational research is to obtain and use the empirical data to formulate, expand or evaluate theory.</li>
						
						<li>Some have termed this reserach as pure or fundamental, also because this research draws its pattern and spirit from the physical sciences. Rigorous and structed type of analysis is also being done in the same.</li>

						<li>Fundamental research also have a little concern for the application of the findings or social usefulness of the findings.</li>
					</ul>	
				<li>Applied research:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Applied research is directed towards the solution of immediate, specific and practical problems. </li>

						<li>The secondary position is acquired by applied research in terms of adding to scientific knowledge.</li>

						<li>It has most of the characteristics of basic research but the methodology, however, is not rigorous as that of basic research. Moreover, its findings are to be evaluated in terms of local applicability and not in terms of universal validity.</li>

						<li>Applied research is mainly intended to improve school practices and add to greater effectiveness in a practical manner.</li>

						<li>Most of the problems faced by teachers, policy planners, and administrators are solved through applied researchers.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>Now last but not the least action research:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Action research is focussed on immediate application, not on the development of theory or on general application.</li>

						<li>Action research places more of its emphasis on problem here and now in a local setting.</li>

						<li>Its findings are to be evaluated in terms of local applicability, not universal validity.</li>

						<li>wikieducator.org says about difference between action and applied research. The applied research is socially useful - application of the knowledge generated to social concerns. Action research on the other hand is useful in solving an immediate, specific problem. Action research is very useful in solving classroom problems.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<P>Now, after listening types of educational research, I hope you all would be curious to know what the heck is the importance of this "educational research".</P> 

			<P>See its very easy, research in education as in the other fields is essential for providing useful and dependable knowledge through which the process of education can be made more effective. </p>
			<p>There are various considerations which emphasize need for researcch in education, some of them are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Education has strong roots in the field like philosphy, history, economics, psychology and sociology. It is through an intensive process of scientific inquiry about the earlier mentioned impact on various aspects of education that sound theories can be established.</li>

				<li>Education is considered as much as science or an art. As a science, it has a corpus (a large collection of written or spoken texts that is used for language research) of knowledge. Since the education depends on a corpus of knowledge, there is need to add scientific knowledge to it for enrichment and improvement. As an art, education seeks to impart knowledge effectively.</li>

				<li>The slogan of democratization of education resulted in the expansion of education. It has given rise to numerous problems like the problem of individual differences, expansion, buildings, discipline and so on. Solutions of such problems by trial and error or by experience from tradition and authority often yielded erroneous (wrong, incorrect) result. We need solutions based on research so that the coming generation is not left to the mercy of errors of outright sins of tradition, ignorance and prejudice (preconcieved opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience).</li>

				<li>During the last two decades, great changes have taken place as a result of the rapid scientific and technological developments. Education has to play an important role so that we can accept the change in a smooth way. It can do so by bringing imporovements in the existing curriculum, textbooks, methods of teching and evaluation.</li>
