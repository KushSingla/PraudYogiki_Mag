			<h2>Aspects of data collection</h2>
			<p>Data Collection is a process of collecting information from all the relevant sources to find answers to the research problem, test the hypothesis and evaluate the outcomes. Data collection is divided into two categories: primary and secondary of data collection.</p>

			<h3>Primary Data Collection Methods</h3>
			<p>Primary data collection methods can be divided into two groups: <b>Quantitative</b> and <b>Qualitative</b> </p>

			<h3>Quantitative data collection methods</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>They are based in mathematical calculations in various formats. Methods of quantitative data collection and analysis include questionnaries with closed-ended questions, methods of correlation and regression, mean, mode and median others. </li>
				<li>Quantitative methods are cheaper to apply and they can be applied within shorter duration of time compared to qualitative methods. Moreover, due to a high level of standardisation of quantitative methods, it is easy to make comparisons of findings. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Qualitative data collection methods</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Qualitative research methods, on the contrary, do not involve numbers or mathematical calculations. Qualitative research is closely associated with words, sounds, feeling, emotions, colours and other elements that are non-quantifiable.</li>
				<li>Qualitative studies aim to ensure greater level of depth of understanding and qualitative data collection methods include interviews, questionnaries with open-ended questions, focus groups, observation, game or role-playing, case studies etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Your choice between quntitative or qualitative methods of data collection depends on the area of your research and the nature of research aims and objectives. </p>

			<h2>Coding data for analysis</h2>
			<p>Data coding is research methodology is a preliminary step to analyzing data. The data that is obtained to analyzing data. The data that is obtained from surveys, experiments or secondary sources are in raw form. This data needs to be refined and organized to evaluate and draw conclusions. Data coding is not an easy job and the person involved in data coding must have knowledge and experience of it.</p>

			<h3>What is a code ?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A <b>code</b> is research methodology is a short word or phrase describing the meaning and context of the whole sentence, phrase or paragraph. </li>
				<li>Th code makes the process of data analysis easier. Numerical quantities can be assigned to codes and thus these quantities can be interpreted. </li>
				<li>Codes help quantify qualitative data and give meaning to raw data.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>What is data coding ?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Data coding</b> is the process of driving codes from the observed data. In qualitative research the data is either obtained from observations, interviews or from questionnaries. </li>
				<li>The purpose of data coding is to bring out the essence and meaning of the data that respondents have provided. </li>
				<li>The data coder extract prelimiary codes from the observed data, the preliminary codes are further filtered and refined to obtain more accurate precise quantities to these code to draw inferences. </li>
				<li>It should be kept in mind that the purpose of data coding is not to just eliminate excessive data but to summarize it meaningfully. The data coder should ascertain that none of the important points of the data have been lost in data coding. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Coding example</h3>
			<p>The example here is to understand the data coding in a better manner. <br>
			"I prefer to shop from a store that provides a large inventory of the same product, every brand and every style in that product range. Usually in these store you get maximum range of products you want to purchase. You get profits thorugh deals and sales." <br>

			The data coder can assign different codes to what the respondent narrated above. These codes might be as following: <br>

			"Preference for horizontal markets" <br>
			"Horizontal integration" <br>
			"Shopping preference" <br>
			</p>

			<h3>Preliminary codes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When data coder assigns codes to the observed data, he cannot manage to assign well-refined codes in the first instance. He has to assing some preliminary codes first so that the data has become concise</li>
				<li>He later on, further refines the codes to get the final codes. It must be kept in mind that codes are not the final words or phrases on the basis of which evaluation will be made. </li>
				<li>The researcher will filter the preliminary codes and then the final codes. He needs a pattern on the basis of which he can categorize the human behavior, action or likes and dislikes. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Final codes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The final codes will help you observe pattern in the data. This pattern is necessary to reach the final evaluation or analysis stage of the data.</li>
				<li>The final codes in data coding mean finding out meaningful words and phrases from the observed data. The respondents often do not choose meaningful words in their responses. </li>
				<li>The coder needs to extract the meaning out of the respondent's wording.</li>
				<li>The codes in their final stage are like topics and themes, these themes generate a whole discussion to get the final results.</li>
				<li>Sometimes the interviewer or the observer writes down some codes as he observes the behavior of the respondent. Such codes are really worthy in the research because these codes cannot be derived from the written responses 
				that the respondents provide.</li>
				<li>The data coder should look for the verbs and the actions that the respondent has mentioned in the text. He should also observe the behavior and where ever possible derive codes. </li>
				<li>One thing should be kept in mind that qualitative data analysis is all about finding out the meanings and interpretations, so the coder should have an eye for such things.</li>
			</ul>
