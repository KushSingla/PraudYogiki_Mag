			<h2>Descriptive Research</h2>
			<p>Descriptive research is known to focus at the finding the current status of some phenomenon, situation or event. <br>
			Descriptive research is used to describe characteristics of a population or phenomenon being studied. It does not answer quesions about how/when/why the characteristics occured. Rather it addresses the "what" question. <br>
			The research method mentioned is usually the best method for collecting information that will demonstrate relationships and describe the world as it exists.<br>
			Descriptive research can be either quantitative or qualitative. The same as mentioned involves gathering data that describe events and then organizes, tabulates, depicts, and describes the data collection. It often uses visual aids such as graphs and charts to aid the reader in understanding the data distribution.
			</p>

			<p>As the name implies, descriptive research methods are used when the researcher wants to describe specific behavior as it occurs in the environment. Depending upon the approach employed, descriptive research involves four main categories: observation, case studies, surveys and content analysis.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Obervational research</b> involves, well, observing. Say for instance you were interested in learning more about how students perform a particular experiment in the laboratory. You would not want to impact their natural inclinations to behave and engage in experimentation, so you would watch from afar or perhaps through a two-way mirror, simply observing and noting what you are seeing. After you complete all of your observations, you can then make inferences about the differences and similarities that were noted. Nothing has been manipulated and hopefully they didn't even know you were there. </li>

				<li>A <b>case study</b> involves making detailed observations about one specific case. For instance, a technical teacher is interested to study in-depth, a group of fresh entrants in a technical college in respect of their problems of adjustments. This could consist of observations or interviews, but like observational research, there is no influence from the researcher. The intent is simply to examine closely the qualities and characteristics of this one case.</li>
				
				<li>A <b>survey</b> is an appropriate study when it is required to describe an existing phenomenon by collecting detailed factual information. Examples are: “polytechnic students’ perceptions of their teacher’s attitudes”, a survey to assess the needs for an engineering programme”, “comparing opinions of two groups of people for including moral education in engineering programme” etc. surveys can be either sample surveys or population/census surveys.</li>
				
				<li>Another desscriptive research method called as content analysis. For instance, suppose being a teacher you are posed with the problem of prescribing a text book for the course being taught by you. A systematic and objecive methods for solving this problem would be to analyze the content of the available text books on the subject. The variables analysed may be the readibility level of the book, examples and illustrations, matching of content covered in the book with the prescribed course content etc. such analysis will provide us with insight into the content of the available books and help us in making a more objective decision on prescribing the text book. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>As per know we know what is descriptive research. We know its concept and purpose, types too. Now for some practical working one should also know some procedural steps for conducting of descriptive research. So, the steps are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Surveys</b> The steps involved in conducting a survey are given below: 
					<ul>
						<li>Define the problem in specific terms the objective or research questions of the study.</li>
						<li>Design the approach for the study
							<ul>
								<li>Deciding the technique and procedure of data collection.</li>
								<li>Selecting the sample.</li>
								<li>Selecting/developing instruments for measurement.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Collect data.</li>
						<li>Analyse data and interpret results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Case study</b> The steps involved in conducting a case study are given below: 
					<ul>
						<li>State in specific terms the objectives of the study.</li>
						<li>Outline the Design/approach for the study
							<ul>
								<li>Selecting the units of study.</li>
								<li>Identifying the available sources of data.</li>
								<li>Selecting/developing data collection procedures.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Collect data.</li>
						<li>Analyse data and interpret results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>Content Analysis</b> Various steps involved in planning a content analysis are given below: 
					<ul>
						<li>State the purpose to be achieved.</li>
						<li>Develop hypothesis or research questions.</li>
						<li>Sample the content.</li>
						<li>Develop the Classification system for analysis.</li>
						<li>Ensure high degree of inter-rater reliability</li>
						<li>Analyse data and interpret results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Ex-Post Facto Research</h2>
			<p>Sometimes you want to study things you can't control- things you can't ethically or physically control e.g.,
				<ul>
					<li>You can't  make someone overweight to study the effects it has in their brain.</li>
					<li>You can't alter someone's eyesight to see how it affects their motor skills.</li>
				</ul></p>
			<p>An ex-post-facto research is a quasi-experimental study examining how an independent variable, present prior to the study, affects a dependent variable.<br><br>
			In it, people are not assigned randomly to an experimental/control group but purposefully putting people in a particular group based on some prior thing they have.<br><br>
			The researcher can observe the independent variables after the event.<br><br>
			For the sake of study, some examples of non-manipulated independent variables are: age, gender, height, weight, socio-economic status, learning styles, family environment, type of institution attended, etc.
			</p>
			<p>Lets study an example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assume a situation in which the skills of BE studnets in engineering drawing are found to be low. A researcher interested in determining the factors that led to this situation.</li>
				<li>He can search and examine the past recors, talk to students & teachers, observe drawing classes, reconstruct past events and indentify factors that might explain the low achievement.</li>
				<li>The factors that the 'R' may find are: 
					<ul>
						<li>Grades obtained in individual subjects and overall grades.</li>
						<li>Motivation of students</li>
						<li>Course content</li>
						<li>Nature of exercises practiced in engineering drawing.</li>
						<li>Teaching & learning activities</li>
						<li>Perforamance assessment procedures etc. (All these have played their part in the past)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>It is clear that the 'R' cannot manipulate the factors, he can only assess them by using  suitable measures and examines if they are causall related to low skills in engineering drawing by using statistical analysis. </li>
				<li>The causes are, thus studied after they have exerted their effects, i.e., <b>ex-post-facto</b>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In studing the causes, Researcher compares group of students who have low skills in engineering drawing with a similar group of students who have high skills in engineering drawing.<br>
			Ex-post-facto involves determining causes of a phenomenon by comparing a group in which the variable is present with a similar group in which the variable is absent or present to a lesser degree.
			</p>
			<p>A perfect example to explain ex-post-facto is as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Imagine a situaion in which there has been a dramatic increase in the number of fatal road accidents in a particular locality.</li>
				<li>An expert is called in to investigate. Naturally, there is no way in which he/she can study the actual accidents because they have happened, nor she can turn to technology for a video replay of the incidents. What she can do, however, is attempt a reconstruction by studying the statistics, examining the accident spots, andd taking note of the statements given by victims and witnesses.</li>
				<li>In this way the expert will be in a position to indentify possible determinants of the accidents:<br>
				Excessive speed, poor road conditions, careless driving, frustration, inefficient vehicles, the effects of drugs or alcohol and so on.
				</li>
				<li>On the basis of her examination, she can formulate hypotheses as to the likely causes and submit them to the appropriate authority in the form of recomendations.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Characteristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Data collected after the presumed causes have occured.</li>
				<li>It does not permit any manipulative control on the independent variable(s); it has already occured. </li>
				<li>It may result in many plausible(seeming reasonable or probable) causes. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Useful for indentifyinig several possible causes of observed possible causes of observed variations in a behavioural pattern.</li>
				<li>It can be used where rigorous experimental research-not possible, i.e., when, 'R' not able to select, control and manipulate the factors necessary to study the cause and effects relationshps directly. </li>
				<li>Less costly and time consuming to conduct.</li>
				<li>A tool for exploring causes-and-effect relations.</li>
				<li>Helpful in generating hypotheses that can be tested by a more rigorous experimental method at a later stage.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It poses difficult in interpretations. It is difficult to label any variable in the problem of study as the cause or effect.</li>
				<li>The outcomes of this research cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships. They can only indicate the existence of a relationshhiip among the variables studied. For the relationship to be termed as causal, it must be verified experimentally.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Procedural Steps:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>State the problem of research.</li>
				<li>Select subjects for the study. Steps are:
					<ul>
						<li>Defining the group that possesses the characteristics of the behavioural pattern being studied.</li>
						<li>Form meaningful sub-groups.</li>
						<li>Select comparison groups.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Select/contruct appropriate tools for measurement and collect data.</li>
				<li>Select appropriate statistical techniques, analyse data and interpret results.</li>
				<li>Write a Research Report</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Correlational Research</h2>
			<p> CR is a type of non-experimental research method in which a researcher measures two variables, understands and assesses the statistical relationship between them with no influence from any extraneous variable. <br><br>
			Our minds can do some brilliant things. For example, it can memorize the jingle of a pizza truck. Louder the jingle, the closer the pizza truck is to us. <i>Who taught us that ? Nobody !</i> We relied on our understanding and came to a conclusion. <i>We don't stop there, do we ?</i> If there are multiple pizza truck in the area and each one has a different jingle, we would memorize it all and relate the jingle to its pizza truck.<br><br>
			This is what correlational research precisely is, establishing a relationship between two variables, "jingle" and "distance of the truck" in this particular example. The correlational study is lookng for variables that seem to interact with each other. When you see one variable changing, you have fair idea of how the other variable will change.
			</p>

			<h3>Correlational research example</h3>
			<p> A term comes into show i.e. correlational coefficient, showing the correlation between two variables (A correlational coefficient is a statistical measure that calculates the strength of the relationship between two variables), a value measured between -1 and +1. Whn the correlation coefficient is close to +1, there is possitive correlation between the two variables. If the value is too close to -1, there is a negative correlation between the two variables. When the value is close to zero, then there is no relationship between the two variables.<br><br>
			Let us take an example to understand correlational research.<br><br>
			Consider hypothetically; a researcher is studying a correlation between cancer and marriage. In this study, there are two variables: disease and marriage. Let us say marriage has a negative association with cancer. This means that married people are less likely to develop cancer.<br><br>
			However, this doesn't necessarily mean that marriage directly avoids cancer. In CR, it is not possible to establish the fact, what causes what. It is misconception that a correlational study involves two quantitative variables. However, the reality is two variables are measured, but neither is changed. This is true independent of whether the variables are quantitative or categorical.
			</p>

			<h3>Types of correlational research </h3>
			<p>Mainly three types of correlational research have been indentified: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Postive correlation:</b> A positive relationship between two variables is when an increase in one variable leads to a rise in the other variable. A decrease in one variable will see a reduction in the other variable. For example, the amount of money a person has might positively correlate with the number of cars the person owns.</li>

				<li><b>Negative Correlation</b> A negative correlation is quite literally the opposite of a positive relationship. If there is an increase in one variable, the second variable will show a decrease, and vice versa. <br><br>

				For example, being educated might negatively correlate with the crime rate when an increase in one variable leads to a decrease in another and vice versa. If the level of education in a country is improved, it can lower crime rates. Please note that this doesn’t mean that lack of education leads to crimes. It only means that a lack of education and crime is believed to have a common reason – poverty.
				</li>
				<li><b>No correlation:</b> In this third type, there is no correlation between the two variables. A change in one variable may not necessarily see a difference in the other variable. For example, being a millionaire and happiness is not correlated. An increase in money doesn’t lead to happiness.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Characterstics of correlation research</h3>
			<p>CR has three main characteristics. They are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-experimental: Correlational study is non-experimental. It means that researchers need not manipulate variables with a scientific methodology to either agree or disagree with a hypothesis. The researcher only measures and observes the relationship between the variables, without altering them or subjecting them to external conditioning.</li>
				<li>Backward-looking: Correlational research only looks back at historical data and observes events in the past. Researchers use it to measure and spot historical patterns between two variables. A correlational study may show a positive relationship between two variables, but this can change in the future.</li>
				<li>Dynamic: The patterns between two variables from correlational research are never constant and are always changing. Two variables having a negative correlation in the past can have a positive correlation relationship in the future due to various factors.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Data collection in CR</h3>
			<p>The distinctive feature of correlational research is that the researcher can’t manipulate either of the variable involved. It doesn’t matter how or where the variables are measured. A researcher could observe participants in a closed environment or a public setting. <br><br>
			Researchers use two data collection methods to collect information in correlational research.
			</p>

			<h4>Naturalistic Obeservation</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Naturalistic observation is a way of data collection in which people’s behavior is observed in their natural environment, in which they typically exist. This method is a type of field research. It could mean a researcher might be observing people in a grocery store, at the cinema, playground, or similar places.</li>
				<li>Researchers who are usually involved in this type of data collection make observations as unobtrusively as possible so that the participants involved in the study are not aware that they are being observed else they might deviate from being their natural self.</li>
				<li>Ethically this method is acceptable if the participants remain anonymous, and if the study is conducted in a public setting, a place where people would not normally expect complete privacy. As mentioned previously, taking an example of the grocery store where people can be observed while collecting an item from the aisle and putting in the shopping bags. This is ethically acceptable, and that is the reason most researchers choose public settings for recording their observations. This data collection method could be both qualitative or quantitative.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Archival data</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Another approach to correlational data is the use of archival data. Archival information is the data that has been previously collected by doing similar kinds of research. Archival data is usually made available through primary research.</li>
				<li>In contrast to naturalistic observation, the information collected through archived data can be quite straightforward. For example, counting the number of people named Richard in the various states of America based on social security records is quite straightforward.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Experimental Research</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A type of evaluation that seeks to determine whether a program or intervention had the intended causal effect on program participants.</li>
				<li>A systematic and logical method for answering the question, ‘if this is done under carefully controlled conditions, what will happen?’</li>
				<li>Manipulation of certain stimuli, treatments, or environmental conditions and observation of how the condition or behaviour of the subject is affected or changed.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Concept og Experimental Research (ER)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>By experiment we refer to that portion of research in which variables are manipulated and their effects upon other variables observed. (Campbell & Stanley, 1966)</li>
				<li>It incorporates those types of research design in which a researcher wants to establish cause-and-effect.</li>
				<li>It involves the comparison of the effects of a particular treatment with that of a different treatment or of no treatment</li>
				<li>Not always characterized by a treatment- non-treatment comparison; varying types, amounts or degrees of experimental factor applied to a number of groups</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Purposes of ER </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Enable a researcher answer, ‘If this is done under carefully controlled conditions, what will happen?'</li>
				<li>Control for rival hypotheses or extraneous variables.</li>
				<li>Predict phenomenon & explain some kind of causation.</li>
				<li>Generalize the relationship between the variables studies for applying to a wider population of interest.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Characteristics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Independent, Dependent and Extraneous Variables
					<ul>
						<li>Manipulation of one variable followed by an observation of the effects of this manipulation on a second variable.</li>
						<li>The variable to be manipulated - the independent/experimental variable.</li>
						<li>The variable that is measured to determine the effect of the experimental treatment - the dependent variable.</li>
						<li>Other factors called extraneous variables affecting the experiment might also attribute to the change (make an attempt to hold all other variables except the dependent variable constant)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The experimental Setting
					<p>Many experiments take place in laboratory settings where control can be exercised over these extraneous variables.</p>
				</li>
				<li>The choice of setting
					<p>Consider the nature and context of the problem being investigated and then choose the design and setting that is most appropriate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Establishing Cause-and-effect (through comparisons)</li>
				<li>Multivariate studies
					<ul>
						<li>Include all of those experiments in which there are either multiple independent variables (age, gender, qualification, institute, method of instruction), or</li>
						<li>multiple dependent variables (test score, attention span, time taken, skill acquisition, performance rating), or in some cases, both</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Controlling Extraneous variables</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Removing the variable</b> selecting cases with uniform characteristics.</li>
				<li><b>Matching cases</b> selecting pairs or set of individuals with identical characteristics</li>
				<li><b>Balancing cases</b>assigning subjects to groups in such a way that the M and the variances are as nearly equal as possible</li>
				<li><b>Analysis of covariance</b> eliminates initial differences between the groups by statistical methods (using pretest mean scores as covariate).</li>
				<li><b>Randomization</b></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Experimental Validity</h3>

			<h4>Internal validity</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The extent that the factors that have been manipulated actually have a genuine effect on the observed consequences in the experimental setting.</li>
				<li>Extraneous variables influence results of experiment in ways that are difficult to evaluate.</li>
				<li>Impossible to eliminate completely.</li>
				<li>Anticipate and take precautions through sound experiment design and execution.</li>
				<li><b>Threat to Internal validity</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Maturation <br>
							Subjects change over a period of time; or bored, tired, wiser or influenced by incidental learning or experiences and their responses on the Post-test are affected.
						</li>
						<li>Testing
							<ul>
								<li>Pretesting at the beginning may produce a change.</li>
								<li>Subjects take a Pre-test and think about some of the items. On the Post-test they change to answers they feel are more acceptable. Experimental group learns from the pre-test).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Unstable instrumentation<br>
							Changes in instruments, calibration of instruments, observers, or scorers may cause changes in the measurements.
						</li>
						<li>Statistical regression<br>
							Groups are chosen because of extreme scores of testing; those scores tend to move toward the mean with repeated measurements even without an experimental variable.
						</li>
						<li>Differential Selection<br>
							Different individuals or groups would have different previous knowledge or ability which would affect the final measurement if not taken into account.
						</li>	
						<li>Experimental mortality<br>
							The loss of subjects from comparison groups could greatly affect the comparisons because of unique characteristics of those subjects. Groups to be compared need to be the same after as before the experiment.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>External Validity</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The extent to which the variable relationships can be generalized to non-experimental situations – other settings, other treatment variables, other measurement variables, and other populations.</li>
				<li><b>Threat to External validity</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Contamination (a type of bias due to knowledge about subjects; outside raters).</li>
						<li>Interference of prior treatment.</li>
						<li>Testing for generalizations to pops not pretested lack validity.</li>
						<li>Selection bias (selected from non-rep pop).</li>
						<li>Placebo-Hawthorne effect</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Experimental Control</h3>
			<p>Quality of experimental design - degree to which a researcher can exercise experimental control; </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Random assignment of individuals to groups.</li>
				<li>Random assignment of treatment.</li>
				<li>Degree to which independent variable can be manipulated by researcher.</li>
				<li>Time when the measurement on dependent variable occur.</li>
				<li>Choice of groups to be measured.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Factorial Design of Research</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Used to examine the effects that the manipulation of at least 2 independent variables (simultaneously at different levels) has upon the dependent variable.</li>
				<li>The impact that each independent variable has on the dependent variable is referred to as the <i><b>main effect</b></i>.</li>
				<li>Dependent variable may also be impacted by the interaction of the independent variables. This is called the <i><b>interaction effect</b></i>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Experimentation Designs</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Pretest-Posttest Design <br>
					Check whether the groups are different before the manipulation starts and the effect of the manipulation. Pretests sometimes influence the effect.
				</li>

				<li>Control Group<br>
					Control groups are designed to measure research bias and measurement effects, such as the Hawthorne Effect or the Placebo Effect. A control group is a group not receiving the same manipulation as the experimental group.
				</li>
				<li>Randomized Controlled Trails <br>
					Randomized Sampling, comparison between an Experimental Group and a Control Group and strict control/randomization of all other variables.
					</li>
				<li>Solomon Four-Group Design <br>
					With two control groups and two experimental groups. Half the groups have a pretest and half do not have a pretest. This to test both the effect itself and the effect of the pretest.
				</li>
				<li>Between subjects Design <br>
					Grouping participants to different conditions.
				</li>
				<li>Without subject Design <br>
					Participants take part in the different conditions.
				</li>
				<li>Counterbalanced measures Design <br>
					Testing the effect of the order of treatments when no control group is available/ethical.
				</li>
				<li>Matched subjects Design <br>
					Matching participants to create similar experimental-and control-groups.
				</li>
				<li>Double-blind experiment <br>
					Neither the researcher, nor the participants, know which is the control group. Results can be affected if the researcher/participants know this.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step-by-step procedure</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and define the problem</li>
				<li>Formulate hypotheses and deduce their consequences</li>
				<li>Determining dependent/independent variables-their levels.</li>
				<li>Construct an experimental design that represents all the elements, conditions, and relations of the consequences.</li>
