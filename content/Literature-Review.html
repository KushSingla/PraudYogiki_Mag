			<h2>What is a literature review ?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A literature review is a body of text having critical points of the current research knowledge, including substantive findings as well as theoretical or methodological knowledge on a particular point.</li>

				<li>It usaually precedes the research proposals and reserach results.</li>

				<li>The ultimate goal of a literature review: is to provide the user with current knowledge on a particular topic, that makes the basis of a research. Also helps to work on the future topics.</li>

				<li>Limit the problem area</li>
				<li>define the problem</li>
				<li>Avoid unnecessary repetition</li>
				<li>Search for new approaches</li>
				<li>Sample the current knowledge</li>
				<li>Recommend suitable methods</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Importance of literature review </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and remove the bias which may be introduced into specific studies by their authors</li>

				<li>Define and delineate the problem area in relation to the existing studies</li>

				<li>Compare methodologies employed in existing studies</li>

				<li>Utilize data collection or other instruments which may already be developed</li>

				<li>Check results obtained by other researchers</li>

				<li>Replicate an existing study in a new context</li>
			</ul>



			<h2>Sources of information</h2>

			<dl>
			<dt>Primary sources</dt>
				 <dd># Author himself reads about the reserach first hand</dd>
				 <dd># Original research work published in journals, research reports, collective works and conference papers.</dd>
				 <dd># Primary sources allow the researchers to get as close as possible to the original research ideas, events, and empirical research as possible.</dd>
				 <dd># Such sources includes: creative works,
				 				first hand or contemporary accounts of events,
				 				the publication of the results of empirical observations or research.</dd>
				 <dd># These sources refer to the first place where a researcher will reveal to the scientific community in a publically accessible document of the results of scientific knowledge. In many cases, the document is rigorously reviewd by peers in research community to maintain integrity of the scientific knowledge.</dd>


			<dt>Secondary sources</dt> 
							<dd># These sources analyze and talk about the information from other sources, mainly primary sources.</dd>
							<dd># These sources organize the primary literature and make retrival of items of interest much easier.
							Author is not directly involved in the research as a researcher, observer or participant.</dd>
							<dd># Others that come under secondary sources are: text books;
							     handbooks;
							     abstracts;
							     research reviews;
							     journal articles;
							     abstracts services;
							     scopus: review articles;
							     biographies;
							     history or historical content;
							     political analysis;
							     essays on scientific contents;
							     monographs;
							     reference works;
							     current awareness tools;
							     trade catalogues.</dd>

			<h2>Organization of literature review</h2>
					
			<p>A general organization of literature review looks like a funnel 
				<ul>
					<li>Broader topics</li>
					<li>Subtopics</li>				         
					<li>studies like yours</li>			  
													   
			 	</ul>								        
			</p>

			<h2>how to organize studies</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Chronological</li>
						<ul>
							<li>by publication date</li>
							<li>by trend</li>
						</ul>	
					<li>thematic</li>
						<ul>
						<li>A structure which considers different themes</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Methodological</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Focuses on the methods of the researcher, e.g., qualitative versus quantitative approaches.</li>
						</ul>
			</ul>

			<h2>Stages of literature survey</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>define the problem</li>
					<li>carry out a search for relevant materials</li>
					<li>Evaluating the credibility of sources</li>
					<li>Scan the work</li>
					<li>critically evaluate the paper</li>
					<li>analyse the findings</li>
				</ul>



			<h2>Writing the text of the review of literature</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>write title of the paper from journal</li>
					<li>its author(s)</li>
					<li>year, volume & place of publication</li>
					<li>page nos.</li>
					<li>purpose, methodology, sample, tools used</li>
					<li>Findings and scope of future research etc.</li>
				</ul>



			<h2>Referencing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>provide full details of all the sources cited in the dissertation</li>
					<li>should include published books or articles, book chapters, technical reports, web sources, etc.</li>
					<li>list alphabetically by author name (name of the first author is the case of works with co-authors)</li>
					<li>make sure you understand the university regulations on plagiarism</li>
					<li>consult your department guidelines for more on referencing style.</li>
				</ul>



			<h2>Rules of referencing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Begin references on a new page with the title references centered at the top.</li>
					<li>Do not underline, italicize or place quotation marks around the references title.</li>
					<li>your references should be alphabetized by the last names of the first author of each source.</li>
					<li>all references should be double-spaced.</li>
					<li>each reference use a handing indentation: the first line of the reference should be flush left, but each additional line of the reference needs to be indended</li>
					<li>In article titles, only the first letter should be capitalized. If a colon appears in the title, the first letter after the colon should also be capitalized. The title should not be placed in quotations, underlined or italicized.</li>
					<li>All major words in the title of a journal should be capitalized; i.e. The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.</li>
