			<p>Before starting the topics mentioned above let's take a look at the basic understanding of the word sampling and its use in our normal life. We all use sampling in our daily life such as a housewife examines only two or three grain of boiling rice to know whether the entire bowl of rice is ready or not. In classrooms also teacher may put questions to one or two students to know whether the entire class is following the instructions given to them during lecture. <br>
			So conciously or unconsciously, we all use different sampling techniques in almost every field.<br><br>
			In research also, Sampling is a very important aspect. In research it is not possible to obtain data from every respondent related to a question of inquiry by researching some portion the respondent, the process is known as sampling. On the basis of sample study, we can generalize and predict the behaviour of mass phenomena.
			</p>

			<h2>Concept of Population and Sample</h2>
			<p>Before going further we need to know some of the terms which are important and going to be used again and again.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Population</b>, it is a complete set of elements. These elements can be people, cases, or piece of data. It can be defined as aggregate of all observations of interest to researchers. for example, people can be CEO's of fortune 500 companies. Cases can be student who have chosen the subject of human resource development as an elective. 
					<ul>
						<li>Population can be finite e.g. all 3<sup>rd</sup> semester students in given.</li>
						<li><b>Infinite population</b> <br> when it is very large when no particular term is associated with category of students. For example, every year number of student's pass out from diploma colleges.</li>
					</ul>
				In research the population can also be termed as:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Target population:</b> Target population is the aggregated (of elements). It refers to the entire group of individuals.</li>
						<li><b>Accessible population:</b> Population the research realistically selects from target population.</li>
					</ul>
				In statistical terms, population is the data under study and parameter is the constant derived from the population.
				</li>

				<li><b>Element:</b> Comprises of single membe of the population.<br><br>
				For example:
					<ul>
						<li>CEO of future 500 company in case of people.</li>
						<li>Recruitment agency in terms of case.</li>
						<li>Customer transaction (sale figure).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>Sampling unit:</b> A member of the sample is known as sampling unit. For example, twenty CEO's of fortune 500 companies, ten recruitment agencies and sale of rupees 4000-/- at a store.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Frame:</b> It comprises all the elements of a population with proper indentification that is available to us for selection of sample at any stage of sampling i.e. concrete listing of all elements.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Error:</b> Arises on account of sampling.</li>

				<li><b>Sample:</b> It is a subset of the population. Only few elements of the population are being selected. Sample helps the researcher to generalize the results, for generalization it must always be representative of the population.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Design:</b>It is a subset of cases from the population choses to present it. By using the subset, we can infer the characteristics of population.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling:</b>It involves selecting a relatively small number of elements (Sample) from a larger defined group (Population) & expecting the information gathered from the small group will enable judgements about the larger group. While selecting this method we need to know

					<ul>
						<li>How much we need (Sample Size) ? </li>
						<li>Whether the information we are setting from a sample is representative of the whole population.</li>
					</ul>
				These are two basic issues addressed through sampling. In simple terms, sampling is a methodological plan to obtain sample from a given population.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Advantages of Sampling</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sampling make possible the study of large heterogeneous (group) population. </b><br><br>
				The universe or population to be studies may be too large or unlimited that it is impossible to reach all of them. Sampling enabling the researcher to reach all through this by studying a small portion of population.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Sampling is for economy</b><br><br>
				Sampling reduces the study population to a reasonable size by which the expenses greatly reduced in terms of men, material and resources. 
				</li>

				<li><b>Speed and accuracy</b><br><br>
				Research must be finished within a reasonable period of time, so that data obtained must be true, valid and reasonable. Sampling increases the speed of research.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Disadvantages of Sampling</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If sampling is biased or non-representative or sample selected is too small the conclusion may not be valid and reliable.</li>
				<li>In research, the respondants to a study must have common characteristic which is the basis of the study which is not possible sometimes.</li>
				<li>If the population is very large there are many sections and sub-sections the sampling procedure becomes complicated which require more labour.</li>
				<li>If the researcher does not know the sampling procedure and technical know how it becomes difficult.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Sampling Techniques/designs</h2>

			<h3>Probability Sampling</h3>
			<p>In probability sampling every member of population has equal and same chance of being selected for the sample. This is useful when researcher wants to make generalization from selected sample. It is regarded as the best and scientific method. A probability sample is drawn randomly from the wider population. This is also known as equal probability samplingh design (EPS).</p>

			<h4>Simple Random Sampling</h4>
			<p>Randomization is a feature of selection process rather than an assumption about structure of population. All individual in the defined have an equal and independent chance of being selected for the sample. The probability of a member being selected is unaffected by the selection of other members of the population. Random does not mean haphazard or hit miss. Selection of item depends on chance, not on personal bias. <br><br>

			For example, Lottery methods where all of the lottery slips are numbered or named have identical size and colour. Slips are then folded and mixed up in the container. A blindfold selection is made of the number of slips required to constitute the desired sample size. <br><br>

			In research methodology, the random tables are being used to select the sample for the given size of population.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Defined the population</li>
						<li>Determine the desired sample size</li>
						<li>List all the members in a population</li>
						<li>Assign each of the individuals on the list a consecutive number from zero to the required number. For example 01-89 or 001-249.</li>
						<li>Select an arbitrary number in the table of random numbers.</li>
						<li>For the selected number look at only the appropriate number of digits.</li>
						<li>If the selected number corresponds to the number assigned to any individual in the population, then the individual is in the sample.</li>
						<li>Repeat the step until the desired sample size is obtained.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Sample selected depends entirely on chance so no personal bias.</li>
						<li>Easy to conduct</li>
						<li>Requires minimum knowledge of the population to be sampling.</li>
						<li>Represents population in a better way.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Need name of all population members.</li>
						<li>Size of sample required is large (compared to stratified)</li>
						<li>May over repesent or under estimate sample members.</li>
						<li>There is difficult in reaching all selected in sample.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


			</p>

			<h4>Systematic Sampling</h4>
			<p>Systematic sampling is the modification of simple random sampling also called interval or gap sampling. It involves selecting subject from a population list in a systematic manner rather than random selection and there is a gap interval, between each selected unit in the sample. The researcher is selectingh K<sup>th</sup> unit until intended sample size is obtained, where k is cal. as below <br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

					K = population size / desired sample size
			<br><br>		
			For example if the size of the population is 3000 and the desired sample size is 100 the K<sup>th</sup> unit will be 30<sup>th</sup>.<br>

			While calculating K<sup>th</sup> unit, it is possible we get fractional value. In this case use approximation procedure:<br><br>

			<ol>
				<li>If fraction value is less than 0.5, it should be omitted.</li>
				<li>If fraction value is more than 0.5, it should be taken as 1.</li>
				<li>If fractional value is exactly 0.5, it should be taken as 1.</li>
			</ol>

			This method is used, where a complex list of population from which sample to be drawn is available. The list of subjects or respondents in the study are arrived or arranged in some systematic or logical manner such as alphabetical arrangements or numerically.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify and define population</li>
						<li>Determine desired sample size</li>
						<li>Obtain list of population (preferably randomized) of the population </li>
						<li>Set 'K' ( K = population size / desired sample size ) </li>
						<li>Start at some random place at the top of population list.</li>
						<li>Take every K<sup>th</sup> name or item until the desired sample in reached, go back to the top of the list.</li>
						<li>If end of list is reached before the desired sample go back to the top of the list.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Sample selection is simple and conveient.</li>
						<li>Time and work labour involved is less.</li>
						<li>If population is sufficiently large, sustematic sampling can often be expected to yield results similar to those obtained by proportional stratified sampling.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


			</p>

			<h4>Stratified Sampling</h4>
			<p>It is an attempt to obtain more reliable sample than simple random method. If the population size large and heterogonous, but consists of several subgroups in which the elements are homogenous by nature or having similar characteristics the population is divide into those subgroups, known as strata. The researcher makes to ensure all strata are presented in the sample and sample members are randomly selected from each other.<br><br>
			
			<b>Following are the characteristics that need to be followed to divide the population into strata: </b>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Base of stratification</b><br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Strata should be constructed in a way that within the strata the units are homogenous.</li>
						<li>Maximize difference among strata (marked difference between strata.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Number of strata (How many strata for a given population ?)</b><br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>More the strata more will be the cost so, limit the number of strata that is feasible.</li>
						<li>More the six strata may be undesirable.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<b>Sample size within strata</b><br>
			<p>It depends upon on how many observations should be taken from each strata. <br><br>

			Stratification can be done by two methods:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Equal Allocation</b> Select equal number of units from all the strata.</li>
					<li><b>Proportional Allocation</b> Select strata members in the sample, proportional to the member in strata.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed (proportional allocation/equal allocation)</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Define population</li>
						<li>Determine desired sample size </li>
						<li>Identify strata for which you want to guarantee appropriate representation (proportional/equal) </li>
						<li>Classify all member of the population as member of one of the indentified starta.</li>
						<li>Randomly select (using Random table) an appropriate number of individuals from subgroups.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>More precise sample</li>
						<li>It balances the uncertainly of random sampling against the bias of deliberate selection.</li>
						<li>Sample represents the desired strata and reduces the time & expenses.</li>
						<li>Accuracy is maximum if strata is formed uniformly and homogeneity.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>There is difficult in reaching all selected in the sample.</li>
						<li>Researcher must know the characteristics populations.</li>
						<li>Utmost care must be excersied while dividing the population into strata, otherwise result will be biased.</li>
						<li>Likelihood that a stratified sample will be more distributed geographically then cost per observation may be high as compare to simple random sampling.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>Cluster Sampling</h4>
			<p>It is also known as multistage sampling. In this technique groups and not individuals are randomly selected. All the group members of the selected groups have similar characteristics. It is used when the characteristics of population is not well known adn list in unavailable.</p>


			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Define the population</li>
						<li>Determine sample size</li>
						<li>Identify define a logical cluster</li>
						<li>Obtain/make list of all cluster in population.</li>
						<li>Estimate average number of population members per cluster.</li>
						<li>Determine the number of clusters needed by dividing the sample size by estimated size of cluster.</li>
						<li>Randomly select needed number of clusters.</li>
						<li>Include in the sample all population members in each select cluster.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Efficient</li>
						<li>Reduce cost and time spend.</li>
						<li>Useful for educational research</li>
						<li>Larger area is covered</li>
						<li>Researchers do not need to name all the members of the population.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Fewer sampling points make it less likely that the sample is representative.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Non-Probability Sampling</h3>
			<p>In case non probability sampling design, the elements of population do not have any known chance of being selected in the sample. These methods are used when no generalization is required. There is an assumption that there is an even distribution of characteristics with in population, believing that any sample would be representative. In non-probability sampling the researcher is targeting a particular group in the full knowledge that it does not represent the whole population.</p>

			<h4>Purposive Sampling</h4>
			<p>Purposive sampling is an arbitrary technique for a particular study. These methods are useful for selecting a sample in relation to some criteria which are considered important for the particular purpose and the individuals are selected because of their expertise, specialized knowledge or characteristics. This method help to achieve representativeness and focus on special unique characteristics.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<p>It involves the selection of the cases when we judge as most appropriate oones for a given study.It is based on the judgment of the researcher, does not aim at securing a cross section of a population. The selection of samples depends upon the subjective judgment of the researchers.</p> 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Less costly and time efficient.</li>
						<li>Use of the best knowledge of the sample subjects.</li>
						<li>Homogeneity of subjects in the sample.</li>
						<li>Better control of significant variables.</li>
						<li>Prevents unnecessary and irrelevant items entering into the sample per chance.</li>
						<li>Given better results of investigator is unbiased and has the capacity of keen observation and sound judgement.</li>
						<li>Ease of checking data used in matching sample groups.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Inability to make generalization concerning the total population.</li>
						<li>Amount of knowledge of the population required in advanced is very high.</li>
						<li>Enough space for bias or prejudices of the investigate to play and influence the selection.</li>
						<li>Not suitable for large samples.</li>
						<li>No equal chance for all the items of the universe being included in the sample.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


			</p>

			<h4>Convenience Sampling</h4>
			<p>Convenience sampling is also known as opportunist or accidental sampling. It involves choosing the nearst individuals the serve as respondent and continuing that process unitl the required sample size has been obtained or those who happen to be available and accessible at that time. In this method the sample is also known as chunks which refers to that fraction of population being investigated which selected neither by probability nor by judgement but by convenience. This design is used for making pilot study, question may be tested and preliminary information may be obtained by chunk before the final sampling design is decided upon. 

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<p>Find some people that are easy to find.</p> 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to use</li>
						<li>Involves who so ever happens to be available that time.</li>
						<li>It would deliver accurrate results when the population is homogeneous.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Biased and unsatisfactory</li>
						<li>Difficulty in determining how much of the effect (dependent variable) result from the cause (independent variable).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>


			</p>

			<h4>Snowball Sampling</h4>
			<p>Snowball sampling is known as chain referral method. In this sampling technique the researcher identifies a small number of individuals who have the characteristics in which they are interested. This is usually done when there is a very small population size is. In this sampling technique interpersonal relations plays an important role.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>A small group is initially indentified.</li>
						<li>Data is collected from the group.</li>
						<li>The identified group members are asked to identify others who might have specialized knowledge regarding the topic, those thus identified recommended.</li>
					</ul> 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>The process is cheap, simple and cost efficient.</li>
						<li>This sampling technique needs little planning and fever work force compared to other sampling techniques.</li>
						<li>It allows the researcher to reach populations that are difficult to sample when using other sampling methods.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Potential for inaccuracy in the researcher's criteria and resulting sample selection.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			</p>


			<h4>Quota sampling</h4>
			<p>Quota sampling is defined as a non-probability sampling method in which reserachers create a sample involving individuals that represent a population. Researchers choose these individuals according to specific traits or qualities. They decide and create quotas so that the market research samples can be useful in collecting data. These samples can be generalized to the entire population. The final subset will be decided only according to the interviewer's or researcher's knowledge of the population.<br><br>

			For example, a cigarette company wants to find out what age group prefers what brand of cigaretters in particular city. He/She applies quotas on the age groups of 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51+. From this information, the researcher gauges the smoking trend among the population of the city.<br><br>

			<b>Main difference etween stratified sampling and quota samplin</b><br>
			Difference is that stratified sampling would select the students using a probability sampling method such as simple random sampling or systematic sampling. In quota sampling, no such technique is used.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Steps to be followed</b><br>
					<ul>
						<p>Identify the characteristics and determine what the population looks like in term of specific qualities. Create “Quota” based on those qualities select sample from each quota. </p>
					</ul> 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Advantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick and easy.</li>
						<li>Saves money and time.</li>
						<li>Preventing decision to be polluted by unnecessary input.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>People who are can accessible are under representation.</li>
						<li>No guidelines in selection of respondents.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
