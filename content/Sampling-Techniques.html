			<p>Before starting the topics mentioned above let's take a look at the basic understanding of the word sampling and its use in our normal life. We all use sampling in our daily life such as a housewife examines only two or three grain of boiling rice to know whether the entire bowl of rice is ready or not. In classrooms also teacher may put questions to one or two students to know whether the entire class is following the instructions given to them during lecture. <br>
			So conciously or unconsciously, we all use different sampling techniques in almost every field.<br><br>
			In research also, Sampling is a very important aspect. In research it is not possible to obtain data from every respondent related to a question of inquiry by researching some portion the respondent, the process is known as sampling. On the basis of sample study, we can generalize and predict the behaviour of mass phenomena.
			</p>

			<h2>Concept of Population and Sample</h2>
			<p>Before going further we need to know some of the terms which are important and going to be used again and again.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Population</b>, it is a complete set of elements. These elements can be people, cases, or piece of data. It can be defined as aggregate of all observations of interest to researchers. for example, people can be CEO's of fortune 500 companies. Cases can be student who have chosen the subject of human resource development as an elective. 
					<ul>
						<li>Population can be finite e.g. all 3<sup>rd</sup> semester students in given.</li>
						<li><b>Infinite population</b> <br> when it is very large when no particular term is associated with category of students. For example, every year number of student's pass out from diploma colleges.</li>
					</ul>
				In research the population can also be termed as:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Target population:</b> Target population is the aggregated (of elements). It refers to the entire group of individuals.</li>
						<li><b>Accessible population:</b> Population the research realistically selects from target population.</li>
					</ul>
				In statistical terms, population is the data under study and parameter is the constant derived from the population.
				</li>

				<li><b>Element:</b> Comprises of single membe of the population.<br><br>
				For example:
					<ul>
						<li>CEO of future 500 company in case of people.</li>
						<li>Recruitment agency in terms of case.</li>
						<li>Customer transaction (sale figure).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><b>Sampling unit:</b> A member of the sample is known as sampling unit. For example, twenty CEO's of fortune 500 companies, ten recruitment agencies and sale of rupees 4000-/- at a store.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Frame:</b> It comprises all the elements of a population with proper indentification that is available to us for selection of sample at any stage of sampling i.e. concrete listing of all elements.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Error:</b> Arises on account of sampling.</li>

				<li><b>Sample:</b> It is a subset of the population. Only few elements of the population are being selected. Sample helps the researcher to generalize the results, for generalization it must always be representative of the population.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling Design:</b>It is a subset of cases from the population choses to present it. By using the subset, we can infer the characteristics of population.</li>

				<li><b>Sampling:</b>It involves selecting a relatively small number of elements (Sample) from a larger defined group (Population) & expecting the information gathered from the small group will enable judgements about the larger group. While selecting this method we need to know

					<ul>
						<li>How much we need (Sample Size) ? </li>
						<li>Whether the information we are setting from a sample is representative of the whole population.</li>
					</ul>
				These are two basic issues addressed through sampling. In simple terms, sampling is a methodological plan to obtain sample from a given population.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Advantages of Sampling</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sampling make possible the study of large heterogeneous (group) population. </b><br><br>
				The universe or population to be studies may be too large or unlimited that it is impossible to reach all of them. Sampling enabling the researcher to reach all through this by studying a small portion of population.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Sampling is for economy</b><br><br>
				Sampling reduces the study population to a reasonable size by which the expenses greatly reduced in terms of men, material and resources. 
				</li>

				<li><b>Speed and accuracy</b><br><br>
				Research must be finished within a reasonable period of time, so that data obtained must be true, valid and reasonable. Sampling increases the speed of research.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Disadvantages of Sampling</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If sampling is biased or non-representative or sample selected is too small the conclusion may not be valid and reliable.</li>
				<li>In research, the respondants to a study must have common characteristic which is the basis of the study which is not possible sometimes.</li>
				<li>If the population is very large there are many sections and sub-sections the sampling procedure becomes complicated which require more labour.</li>
				<li>If the researcher does not know the sampling procedure and technical know how it becomes difficult.</li>
			</ul>
